<h1>Web-Based Applications Design and Development</h1>
<h2>Me and My Course</h2>

<p><b>Joseph Steiger</b> is a senior at UNCC currently finishing a Bachelor degree in Computer Science with a
    concentration on Software, Systems, and Networking. They are hoping to finish their academic career and begin work
    in a CS field by this Spring.</p>

<p><b>Joseph Steiger</b> is taking this course out of both a <em>necessity for elective credit</em> and a <em>genuine interest in
    developing front end skills</em> to better diversify software development capabilities. They have a small amount of
    experience in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in the past, and they are hoping to further expand upon that knowledge</p>

<p>His strategy for being successful in this course mostly involves staying on top of due dates and spending time
    studying where necessary. Proper time dedication and an understanding of what has to be done before you begin
    working on it is key to finishing work in a timely manner. </p>
